# multicast-system

This is a system for supporting persistent asynchronous multicast on top of TCP. This will be based on a coordinator-participant paradigm.

# Persistent and Asynchronous Multicast Model

In a multicast communication paradigm, the messages sent to a multicast group are received by
all members of the group (including the sender) at the time the message was sent. As we have
discussed in the class, asynchronous implies that a sender is not blocked until everyone in the
multicast group receives the message -- it is unblocked as soon as it receives an
acknowledgement from the coordinator. Persistence guarantee implies that an offline
participant, upon reconnection, will receive messages that were sent when it was offline. If a
participant is online when a message was multicast, it should get the message immediately (i.e.,
messages should not be bundled for online participants).
You will implement a slightly modified version of persistence called “temporally-bound
persistence”. In this model, if a participant is offline more than some specified time threshold
(say td), upon reconnecting, it will receive messages that were sent in the past td seconds. In
other words, the messages sent before td will be permanently lost to the participant. If a
participant is disconnected less than or equal to td seconds, it should not lose any messages.
The participants send and receive multicast messages to and from the coordinator (i.e.,
participants do not directly communicate with each other). The coordinator manages the
multicast group, handles all communication and stores messages for persistence. 

# Participant Details

It is assumed that each participant has a unique ID provided in the configuration file (see
below). For simplicity, it is assumed that a participant does not migrate from one host to
another. However, it may change its ports upon disconnection and reconnection.
Each participant has at least two threads (you can have more threads depending on your
design). One thread (thread-A) is for receiving user commands. The second thread (thread-B)
waits on a specified port for receiving multicast messages from the coordinator (when the
participant is online). All the multicast messages received by the thread must be logged in the
message log file (see below). When the participant is offline, thread-B should relinquish the
port (the thread may be killed or it just may be dormant as per your design). All the messages
received by a participant should be logged in a file in the order they were received.
The participant program will have one command-line parameter, namely, the configuration file
name. The configuration file will have the following format. The first line indicates the ID of the
participant. The second line indicates the message log file name. The third line indicates the IP 
address and port number of the coordinator. An example participant configuration file can be
found at [here](http://www.cs.uga.edu/~laks/DCS-2016-Sp/pp3/PP3-participant-conf.txt).
The participant should support the following user commands (format of the command is
provided in parenthesis).

## Register (register [portnumber])

Participant has to register with the coordinator
specifying its ID, IP address and port number where its thread-B will receive multicast messages
(thread-B has to be operational before sending the message to the coordinator). Upon
successful registration, the participant is a member of the multicast group and will begin
receiving messages.
## Deregister (deregister)

Participant indicates to the coordinator that it is no longer belongs
to the multicast group. Please note that this is different than being disconnected. A participant
that deregisters, may register again. But it will not get any messages that were sent since its
deregistration (i.e., it will be treated as a new entrant). Thread-B will relinquish the port and
may become dormant or die.
## Disconnect (disconnect)

Participant indicates to the coordinator that it is temporarily going
offline. The coordinator will have to send it messages sent during disconnection (subject to
temporal constraint). Thread-B will relinquish the port and may become dormant or die.
## Reconnect (reconnect [portnumber])

Participant indicates to the coordinator that it is
online and it will specify the IP address and port number where its thread-B will receive
multicast messages (thread-B has to be operational before sending the message to the
coordinator).
## Multicast Send (msend [message])

Multicast [message] to all current members. Note that
[message] is an alpha-numeric string (e.g., UGACSRocks). The participant sends the message to
the coordinator and unblocks after an acknowledgement is received.

# Coordinator Details
As mentioned before, the coordinator manages the multicast group, handles all communication
and stores messages for persistence. For simplicity, it is assumed that there is only one
multicast group and all registered participants belong to the same group.
The coordinator program will have one command-line parameter, namely, the configuration file
name. The configuration file will have the following format. The first line indicates the port
number where the coordinator will wait for incoming messages from participants. The second
line indicates the persistence time threshold (td) in seconds. An example coordinator
configuration file can be found at [here](http://www.cs.uga.edu/~laks/DCS-2016-Sp/pp3/PP3-
coordinator-conf.txt).
When the coordinator starts up, the multicast group is assumed to be empty. Participants join
the group through register messages. Theoretically, you can have as many threads as you want
for the coordinator. But remember that creating large number of threads will create a 
performance bottleneck. Therefore limiting threads to a small number (< 10) is a good idea.
When the coordinator gets a message from a participant, it first parses the message,
acknowledges the receipt of the message, closes the connection and then performs the
requested action. For example, if it receives a “register” message, it will add the participant to
the member list. If it receives a multicast message, it will send the message to the members
that are currently online. If any members are offline, it will store the message for providing
persistence.
